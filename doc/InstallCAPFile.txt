Installing CAP file on YubiKey NEO
----------------------------------

After building the CAP file you can install it on a NEO.  You need to
have a NEO with default card manager keys, or know the card manager
keys.

Enable CCID mode on the NEO
---------------------------

First make sure the YubiKey NEO is in the HID/CCID or CCID mode.  You
may use the YubiKey NEO Manager GUI:
https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-neo-manager/

If you prefer command line tools, you may use the 'ykpers' and
'ykneomgr' tools depending on which mode the YubiKey NEO is in.  See:
https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-personalization/
https://developers.yubico.com/libykneomgr/

Refer to the documentation of these projects on how to mode switch the
YubiKey NEO.

Installing CAP file to NEO
--------------------------

Install the gpshell tool from Global Platform:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/globalplatform/

We have tested the combination of GlobalPlatform Library version
6.0.0, GPShell version 1.4.4, and gppcscconnectionplugin version
1.1.0.

You need to whitelist the device in /etc/libccid_Info.plist which
happens automatically if you have a recent libccid.

WARNING!  When you load a new CAP file, everything on the device for
that app is erased.  Keep a backup of your credentials.

When the CAP file has been built and is available in the default path,
you may use the gpshell tool to load it:

  $ gpshell gpinstall.txt

You can modify the gpinstall.txt file if you have other card manager
keys.

That's it!
